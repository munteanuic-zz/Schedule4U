## Description:
 - Schedule4U is an app that helps students and young professionals manage their time.
 - A user study was conducted and it resulted in the following implications for design:
   - Avoiding  procrastination is important for productivity
   - Most productive time of day should be considered when scheduling
   - Finding time for things other than work/school  like family, friends, hobbies, etc
   - Users like to have a clear sense of priority and progress when completing tasks
   - Sharing schedule across different platforms while accounting for differences in time zones
 - Based on these key features, we created our app, which the following pages/features:
   - A main page, containing buttons for all the subpages.
   - **To Do's for Today**: This is where all the tasks that need to be completed today will show up. Users can edit, delete, check off tasks.
   - **Notifications**: The users will get notifications throughout the day about what tasks they scheduled. The can see all the notifications here and delete those that they don't want to see anymore.
   - **Recommended Events**: The events that don't have a set time and date will be listed here, based on their priority. The users can choose what task to do next when they don't know what to do.
   - **Calendar**: The events for different days are stored here. The user can edit, delete, and add tasks from this page.
   - **Productivity Score**: Each week, the maximum score a user can have is equal to the number of tasks scheduled. Each completed task gives the user one extra point.
   - Every page has an "About me" that lets the user know how they can use it.
 - The app was analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively using user testing.
